Desired features I would like to implement in the future:
 - [ ] Actions that customize how the build artifact is proceesed to be send and executed.
   - For example, some projects depend on data files (e.g: GTK apps) to be presend, to it would be desirable to send over a `tar.gz` to be extracted and run.
 - [ ] An ssh integration that allows `rdev` to be sent over to the other machine (runner or sender) and run automagically.
 - [ ] Add a config file to save some settings for ease of use.
   - [ ] Aliases for frequently used ADDRs
   - [ ] Presets for frequently used connections
